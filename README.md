# Early Pregnancy Prediction System

## Overview

The Early Pregnancy Prediction System is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of early pregnancies based on historical data. The application utilizes various demographic and socio-economic features to provide insights into early pregnancy trends. This can help healthcare professionals and policymakers in making informed decisions and implementing preventive measures.

## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of early pregnancies.
- Utilizes demographic data including age, education level, marital status, and socioeconomic status.
- Analyzes historical data to identify patterns and trends.
- Easy to use interface for inputting data and obtaining predictions.

## Dataset

The model uses a CSV file named `early_pregnancy_data.csv` containing historical data on early pregnancies. The dataset includes the following columns:

- **age**: Age of the individual (in years).
- **education_level**: Highest level of education attained (e.g., High School, Some College, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate).
- **previous_pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies the individual has had before.
- **marital_status**: Marital status of the individual (Single or Married).
- **socioeconomic_status**: Socioeconomic status (Low, Medium, High).
- **region**: Area of residence (Urban or Rural).
- **early_pregnancy**: A binary indicator (1 for early pregnancy, 0 for not).

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You will also need to install the required libraries. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/early-pregnancy-prediction.git
   cd early-pregnancy-prediction 



## Install the required packages:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn 

Prepare the dataset:

Ensure that the early_pregnancy_data.csv file is located in the same directory as your Python script.

## Usage
Run the prediction script:

Execute the predict.py script to run the prediction model:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py
Input your data:

Modify the predict.py file to include the data for prediction based on the required format. Ensure the input data matches the format used in the CSV file.

View the results:

After running the script, the output will display the prediction results, indicating the likelihood of early pregnancy based on the input data.

Example Input
You can provide input data in the following format:

python
Copy code
input_data = {
    'age': 18,
    'education_level': 'Some College',
    'previous_pregnancies': 1,
    'marital_status': 'Single',
    'socioeconomic_status': 'Medium',
    'region': 'Urban'
}
